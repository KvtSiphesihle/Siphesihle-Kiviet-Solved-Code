#To solve this problem,I needed to reformat a string like a alphabetical characters changing between uppercase and lowercase, while leaving non-alphabetical characters (like numbers, spaces, and special characters) unchanged. 
# The position of non-alphabetical characters should not change the alternating case order.
# with the above python script i was able to achieve that.
